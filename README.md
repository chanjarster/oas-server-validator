# openapi-mockmvc

A library to validating HTTP responses, which are received from an API server,  against [OpenAPI V3][1] spec

Designed to be used independently of any HTTP library or framework.

This library will make good requests(satisfy spec) and bad requests(not satisfy spec) to test if server-side implementation satisfies the spec.
